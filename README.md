    Barangay Document Issuance System (Java Console Based Program)

This project is a system designed to manage barangay documents across multiple barangays. It includes features such as user and admin login and registration. 
Users can request documents based on the available document types defined for each barangay within the system. 
Once a request is submitted, an admin will verify it and decide whether to approve or decline the request.
One of the key features of the system is its ability to automatically generate the requested document, which includes both the document content and the user's information. 
Additionally, the system includes a built-in payment module, which is currently under development.
